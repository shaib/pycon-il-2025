## Meet Our Sponsor - Nym
Nym is on a mission to simplify U.S. healthcare by automating the accurate interpretation of clinical language. Founded with the vision that technology should truly work for healthcare, our interdisciplinary team combines expertise from physicians, machine learning engineers, computational linguists, engineers, and medical coders to solve one of the healthcare industry’s most persistent challenges: medical coding. Our autonomous medical coding engine, powered by proprietary Clinical Language Understanding (CLU) technology, processes over 6 million patient charts annually across 300+ U.S. healthcare facilities with 95%+ accuracy. By eliminating the manual coding processes that have remained largely unchanged since the 1960s, we’re not just improving efficiency - we’re also freeing up valuable time and resources that can be invested in what matters most: patient care.
