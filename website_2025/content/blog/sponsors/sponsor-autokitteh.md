## Meet Our Sponsor - AutoKitteh
Backed by leading VCs, AutoKitteh is redefining workflow automation for technical builders by combining the creativity of vibe coding with the convenience of no-code—and adding something the others don’t: durability.

With the platform, technical builders can connect APIs like Slack, GitHub, Gmail, and more in just a few lines of Python. It’s a powerful alternative to tools like n8n and Zapier, offering the flexibility of Python alongside production-grade reliability. Behind the scenes, it handles execution, app connectivity, state management, recovery from infrastructure failures, workflow coordination, and more—so builders can focus on logic, not plumbing.

Available as both an open-source project and a SaaS offering, it comes with built-in AI assistance so developers can practice vibe automation, creating applications with minimal code while keeping full control. The result: faster builds, less maintenance, and workflows that don’t just work—they keep working.
