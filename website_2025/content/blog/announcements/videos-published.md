PyCon Israel 2025 is proud to announce that the videos recorded at the
day of talks are finally available. It took a bit longer than we
expected (and we take the full responsibility for that), but they're
finally out.

Go catch up on whatever you missed -- there are
[playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConIsrael/playlists) for the
whole day as well as per hall.

[High Resolution Photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/vdUwzsKGra1P8d729) from that
day are available in one album. Low resolution photos have been split between 
[talks](https://photos.app.goo.gl/pTzTY7jrYcWmvcQN9) and 
[atmosphere](https://photos.app.goo.gl/31Yz1drk6xX9ReCZ6) albums. To our regret, 
the sets are not exactly congruent; some photos are only available in one of the 
resolutions.

Thanks to everyone who made this happen!
