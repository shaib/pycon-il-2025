### Tickets for PyCon Israel Workshops

PyCon Israel is excited to announce that our [ticketing
page](https://ti.to/hamakor/pycon2025) now offers also tickets for
[two
workshops](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/pycon-2025/schedule/#2025-09-10),
to be held at Reichman University on Wednesday 10.9.

As in all recent years, we will hold on the day after the conference
talks, a more modest event of workshops: Long sessions of intense
learning by guided work, in small classes of up to 25 students. This
year, setting up this event ran into some hurdles and delays, but it
all came through in the end.

As in previous years, the workshops are free of charge, but because
seats in them are so limited, registration is at a token cost -- and
the money is returned to people who show up; that is, the intention is
to charge only if you take up a seat, and leave it unused.

We thank Reichman University for making the venue available to us.  
Join us on these workshops too!
