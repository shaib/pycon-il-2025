We're happy to announce that ticket sales are now open.

But first, a few words about our Pricing Policy.

We have always strived to keep PyCon Israel ticket prices low, to make
the conference accessible to a wide and diverse audience. Before 2024,
the ticket price was far below the conference costs per attendee
(PyCon Israel is run by volunteers, and was never intended to make a
profit). But as the majority of tickets ended up being purchased by
companies for their employees, it meant that the conference was
subsidizing these companies (with volunteer work and sponsors money).

Since last year, we’re doing things differently. Tickets purchased by
companies will be sold at a price that reflects actual costs to the
conference (full price - 450₪), and tickets for individuals, at a more
affordable price (250₪). We trust conference goers not abuse this
policy, and hope to be able to keep the lower price available for
individuals.
