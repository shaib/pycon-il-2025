### Discounted diversity tickets available for PyCon 2025

We are pleased to offer discounted tickets to support individuals from
underrepresented or marginalized groups in tech - aiming to foster
participation, equity and inclusion in the Israeli Python community.
PyCon Israel is a 100% volunteer-run, non-profit initiative — by the
community and for the community.  As in every year, we champion
initiatives to encourage diversity and work to make the event and its
content accessible to a wide range of audiences.  Our commitment
drives us to actively seek speakers and organizers from different
parts of the community and to provide subsidized tickets for
participants from underrepresented groups (as well as active-duty and
reserves military personnel).

Join us - PyCon is the largest and official annual conference in
Israel for Python developers. This year, we’re expecting over 600
participants — from beginners to seasoned professionals — all coming
together to enjoy inspiring talks, connect with sponsors, and
more. It’s the perfect opportunity to step away from the office or
home, learn something new, and build valuable connections within the
Python community.
